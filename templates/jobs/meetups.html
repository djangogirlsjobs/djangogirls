            Did you know that Dori, Django Girls alumn from our first event in Berlin, got a job because she gave a talk about Django Girls at her local Django meetup in Budapest? That’s why your local meetups and user groups can help you make a career in tech. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can find (or add!) meetups in your city where programmers meet to talk about technology. They all have published Code of Conduct, we checked! 
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page we only list meetups and groups that are friendly to beginners and have a published Code of Conduct. If you see a meetup that doesn’t meet this requirements, please do let us know. We care about you.
