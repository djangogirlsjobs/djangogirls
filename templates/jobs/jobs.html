                        Working as a software developer is a great way to become one. There is lots of companies out there who are hiring, but how to tell which one is good? We talked to a lot of them and here you can find offers from companies who hire beginners and want to train them. Theyâ€™re not targeting women only, but they do care about diversity in a workplace. We trust they do the right things.
