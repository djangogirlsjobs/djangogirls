                       Working as a software developer is a great way to become one. There are lots of companies out there who are hiring, but how can you tell which ones are good? We have talked to a lot of them and here you can find offers from companies who hire beginners and want to train them. Theyâ€™re not targeting women only, but they do care about diversity in a workplace. We trust they do the right things.
                        On this page we only list offers that require no experience, from companies who want to hire beginners and care about diversity.
